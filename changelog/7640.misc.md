The [`TrainingDataImporter` interface](training-data-importers.mdx) now requires the
implementation of a new method `get_conversation_tests`. It is used to import 
conversation test files. Its signature looks as follows:

```python

 async def get_conversation_tests(
        self, parse_md_as_end_to_end_tests: bool = False
    ) -> StoryGraph:
        """Retrieves the stories that should be used for testing.

        Args:
            parse_md_as_end_to_end_tests: `True` if markdown story files should parsed
                as end-to-end conversation tests.

        Returns:
            `StoryGraph` containing all loaded stories.
        """
        # TODO: Drop `parse_md_as_end_to_end_tests` in Rasa Open Source when removing
        # Markdown support
        raise NotImplementedError()
```
