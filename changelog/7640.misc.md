The [`TrainingDataImporter` interface](training-data-importers.mdx) now permits the
implementation of a method `get_conversation_tests` which specifically retrieves
[end-to-end conversation tests](testing-your-assistant.mdx#writing-test-stories). 
Its signature looks as follows:

```python

 async def get_conversation_tests(self) -> StoryGraph:
        """Retrieves end-to-end conversation stories for testing.

        Returns:
            `StoryGraph` containing all loaded stories.
        """
        pass
```
